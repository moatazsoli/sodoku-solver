This program solves a sodoku game given in a .txt file.
The program outputs the grid given in the file and then outputs the possible solutions to the given sodoku file.

4 input files are included in the "testing files" folder in the project directory for testing the program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Format of the input File:
1- the first line in the input file should have the count of the given numbers in the game.
2- then the x and y coordinates of the numbers are used. "TAB space" has to be used between inputs
   e.g:

count
x	y	number
